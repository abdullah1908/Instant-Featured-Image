Auto Feature Image
==================

WordPress plugin that automatically sets an image as a featured image at the same time as it is inserted into the post content.

## What does this plugin do?

When activated, this plugin adds a new button next to the "insert into post" button in the media manager modal. When clicked, this button will insert your selected media and then, if you have selected an image, set that image as the post's featured image. It is possible to select multiple media items to insert, so this plugin will set the last image in the set as the featured image.

## Why did you build this plugin?

After @defries [tweeted](https://twitter.com/DeFries/status/481754387329875968) about this issue, I set out to solve it.
